                a <b>Front-End Developer</b>, I
                            began my professional career three years ago and
                            have since refined my skills in the creation of
                            <b>semantic</b>, <b>fast</b>, and <b>responsive
                                websites</b>. Being a
                            developer requires a commitment to never-ending
                            learning, so here I am, currently enrolled in
                            Algonquin College's two-year Computer Programming
                            programme learning the Back-End, specifically Object
                            Oriented Programming, Databases, and Linux. During
                            my
                            free time, I usually go on biking or sometimes
                            running, but often
                            watching Netlfix series.

                    I am a violist, violinist, and music teacher.

                    <br>
                    I started to play the violin when I was 6 years old. Since then, I got interested in many other things but music won my heart and now I do my living from it.

                    <br>
                    I am very passionate about the continuous process of learning and teaching.

                    <br>
                    I also am interested in technology and how it interacts with the culture.
